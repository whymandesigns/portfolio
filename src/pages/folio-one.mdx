## Background

As Toptal experienced hypergrowth, it became a business requirement that the product practice had to scale to keep up with evolving company initiatives. The main struggle and challenge was with scaling the system and bringing the much needed adoption and consistency across their three main user-facing portals (Staff, Client, and Talent Portals), multiple internal tools (CMS Tool, TopTeam, TopTaste, TopShop), external tools (Time Tracker, Screenshot app), and numerous new initiatives.

With so many projects running in parallel, a lack of cohesion led to frequent custom designs that carried over into the implementation phase, increasing costs and technical debt, and reducing the ROI for every product-focused team member. Maintaining consistency became an ever-greater challenge as the company’s ecosystem continued to expand. So we needed to systemize a few things.

### Key Achievements

- Increased component adoption rate from a low 18% to 60% across talent portal feature teams within the first six months.
- Reduced the number of custom components created outside the system by 68%.
- Implemented adoption metrics on Grafana, tracking component usage by platform, css overrides, and achieved a 100% visibility into system performance.
- A new product initiative (Hireglobal) was built from scratch in just 2 months, using 92% of components from the design system.
- Reduced component requests by 20% by enabling designers and developers to contribute directly to the system.
- Built thorough documentation and covered 45% of core components & patterns, prioritizing those with the highest usage rates and vital user journeys.
- Went from 30% up to 90% color accessibility compliance across all styles, tokens, and components, ensuring they meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for contrast and readability.

## Workshops, User Research & Feedback

During my initial weeks, my focus was on learning and absorbing as much from all the product teams. I wanted to understand how the existing system was being used, identify pain points, and uncover opportunities for improvement. This phase is always crucial to setup a strategy, resource allocations and have an idea on priorities plus it ensures that any changes or enhancements I made were grounded in real-world needs and challenges.

</div>

### Research Goals

- How are designers and engineers currently using the system in their daily workflow?
- What aspects of the design system are working well, and where are the pain points?
- How clear, accessible, and easy to navigate is the documentation, particularly when searching for specific information?
- Are there any gaps or inconsistencies in the system?
- What specific challenges do teams face during collaboration or when implementing components?

### Action Points

- Stop neglecting use cases in responsive design.
- Improve the handoff process between design and development.
- Start creating subsystems for the other platforms that require its own components.
- Improve the component architecture in Figma with more nested properties.
- More transparency and communication around what is being built to avoid duplication of work and have an accessible roadmap.
- Stop relying on outdated or fragmented documentation.
- Clearer process and more formal process for new requests, bugs etc.

## Establishing a Formal Process

Based on discussions, I focused on addressing the designer insecurity through their design process. To clarify this process, I outlined what steps should be taken when designers work on new initiatives, how to work with the system and what to do if a new component is required. This was captured in this flowchart, which was then shared with the wider team.

## Structure & Organization

Setting up the right foundations was really important for the project so I began by organizing the Figma libraries, starting with the completion of the migration from Sketch. I recreated the components in Figma and improved the component architecture by applying best practices like variants, props, and auto-layouts and made sure prop names align with storybook react naming conventions.

Next, I moved and gathered all the foundational styles into their own shared library. The long-term goal for this system was to not only serve the product teams but also to support the entire company, including marketing, branding, and creative teams.

The foundations library included:

- Typography
- Color
- Spacing
- Shadows
- Radii
- Global Tokens

This global library provided centralized control over all core styles, which proved to be an excellent decision as the projects scaled significantly.

## Token Structure

Design tokens are great and a must to build, scale and maintain design systems, however they have to be done right, kept simple and not over-engineered with layers of abstraction.

We core designers and developers so long at the company that memorized the hex values, so it was always going to be a challenge to introduce a new way of working.

So my proposal was to keep things simple by using the global token (blue-500) and introducing a commonly used abstraction layer—like $bg-blue-500 or $text-blue-500. This approach creates a flexible, widely scoped token that's abstract enough to support consistency while allowing adaptability across the system.

Unnecessary complexity makes tokens harder to maintain and creates a cognitive load for both designers and devlopers, making it hard to choose the correct token.

## Documentation

At the time, our documentation was only available in a separate Figma files, which created several challenges: it wasn’t widely adopted, wasn’t searchable, and was difficult to maintain. While exploring third-party solutions, budget constraints prevented us from adopting a dedicated tool.

Determined to find a solution, I started using Confluence, which was ‘free’ and accessible company-wide and could embed Figma and Storybook iframes. This provided a centralized space for usage guidelines and best practices, offering an immediate improvement while laying the groundwork to eventually justify investment in our own microsite or a 3rd party tool like zeroheight.

## Success Story

In Q1 of 2024, the company announced a major initiative to build a new HRIS and payroll system from scratch, [HireGlobal](//www.toptal.com/hireglobal). This was a critical business project with tight deadlines and high expectations. The dedicated product team worked tirelessly to take the product from concept to release in under two and half months. One of the key successes to the speed of this release was the heavy reliance on the design system.

A staggering 92% of the UI used were system components from BASE Product library. This level of reusability not only streamlined the design and development process but also validated the work we had done to make BASE a reliable and scalable resource for product teams across the company.
